The test3 is the same as Test2, but it adds a new tier (layer) in the application, so the test application transforms now in a three tier application or three layer application.

The first tier (layer) is the (calls for) GUI LAYER, you find it in project Test3JCFramework.
The second tier (layer) is the (calls for) BUSINESS or DOMAIN LAYER, you find it in project Test3JCBusiness.
The third one is the (calls for) DATABASE LAYER, you find it in the project JCFramework and this is the common layer to all applications.
